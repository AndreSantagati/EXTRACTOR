Observed ransomware attacks have, as is to be expected, increased significantly from January 2024 to February 2024 from 285 to 416 cases, marking a 46% increase month on month which is once again the highest figure that we have witnessed in February (73% higher than February 2023). This pattern has persisted for as long as NCC Group has been tracking hack & leak ransomware groups, so it is not expected to change in the near future; threat groups exhibit a seasonal lull around Christmas and the New Year, and subsequently  return to their normal operations in February. If 2024 is to follow the same pattern as 2023, we can expect a further increase going into March as we start to reach the baseline for 2024’s ransomware activity, which will likely consistently surpass that of 2023 based on previous trends. Something of note that will be explored in the Threat Actors section of this report is that we have quite a mix of top threat actors this month (excluding the usual LockBit 3.0) with Hunters and Qilin pushing their way into the top 3. Perhaps this implies a change in the most active threat actors for 2024? Either way, NCC Group will continue to track the activity of hack & leak ransomware groups. February’s ransomware targeting by sector continued to see Industrials  domineer the landscape with 134 ransomware attacksoccurring in the sector, accounting for 32% of the attacks observed in February. When compared to January there was a significant increase from 96 by 40% which replicates the increasing trend seen in 2023. The trend in 2023 saw January have a seasonal dip and a revival in the proceeding February increasing by 63%. This trend has been observed again in 2024 but down proportionally 23% year on year (YoY). Whilst the month on month percentage increase was less than last year; the YoY for February saw an additional 54 attacks meaning an increase of 68%. Although, February saw the Technology sector drop out of the top 3 and move three positions to number 6, it wasn’t due to a decrease in ransomware attacks. In fact, the Technology sector saw a total of 29 attacks in February, a nearly 4% (+1) increase compared with a month earlier (28). The Technology Sector accounted for 7% observed in the month of February. The largest decrease in attacks came in the Academic & Educational Services sector where they saw a decline month on month by 41% from 17 attacks in January to 10 in February (-7). This sector also saw their position in the list drop three positions to 10 and accounted for 2% of observed attacks in the month. Government Activity enters the top 10 at position 7 in the list for the first time in 2024, accounting for nearly 4% (15) of the total ransomware attacks observed. This is an increase month on month by 400% (+12) when compared with 3 attacks in January 2024. Government Activity replaces Institutions, Associations & Organisations in the list who saw the activity in their sector decrease by just under 29% month on month to 10 ransomware attacks in February 2024 causing them to lose their position in NCC Group’s top 10 only accounting for 2% of attacks. It is noteworthy that Consumer Non-Cyclicals are up two positions in February attributed to their increase in attacks by 135% (40) and account for 10% of the total activity observed in the month. Additionally, Basic Materials, Financials, and Real Estate all saw their position change to move up the list by one position each respectively. Month on month Basic Materials saw an increase of 88% to 32 attacks, Financials an increase of 27% to 14 and Real Estate an increase of 50% to 12 attacks. The three sectors accounted for a combined 14% of observed attacks. February was quite the standout month for ransomware. Not only because of the scale of activity, 46% higher than January 2024 and 73% higher than February 2023, but also because of the shift in Threat Actor activity levels as well as multiple notable events which have the potential to significantly shake up the ransomware threat landscape. Continuing their 7-month reign, LockBit 3.0 is once again the most active group for February with 110 credited attacks to their name. This is nearly double the 64 attacks they were credited with in January, and significantly higher than the total month on month percentage increase from January, at a 72% increase. Dwarfed by LockBit’s activity, and yet the second most active threat group for the month, comes Hunters, with 33 attacks to their name. Though Hunters have appeared in the list of ten most-active monthly threat groups before, this is the first time they have been in the top three. Next, as joint 4th most-active groups, come Qilin and BlackCat with 30 attacks apiece. Though BlackCat is accustomed to being included in the most active monthly threat groups, Qilin, like Hunters, is relatively new to these levels of activity. It is perhaps a bit early in the year to predict what levels of activity we are likely to see from them in the future, it is worth noting a shift in the usual actors we see following behind LockBit.
